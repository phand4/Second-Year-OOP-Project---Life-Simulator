# Second-Year-OOP-Project---Life-Simulator
Life Simulator for OOP Project - Second Year DIT

This project is a text based, randomly generated, life simulation game.

The thought process of this was to populate a database of names, occupations, places, and events and to give the user a random person to live out their life interacting with other randomly generated people from the same database.
